        <p class="text">Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that 
            have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It combines 
            graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative 
            and individualistic techniques. anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as 
            a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant 
            characters and fantastical themes.The culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning 
            may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan.
            For simplicity, many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product.</p>
